# Web Application Attacks
**Objective**: This project demonstrates hands-on experience in identifying and exploiting SQL Injection and Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities using WebGoat and DVWA.

## Tools Used
- **WebGoat**: A deliberately insecure web application by OWASP for training on web vulnerabilities.
- **DVWA (Damn Vulnerable Web Application)**: A safe, legal environment to practice web security.

## Key Concepts
- **SQL Injection**: Used input like `' OR '1'='1'--` to dump database information.
- **XSS**: Injected scripts to exploit the XSS vulnerability and capture session cookies.

## Lab Overview
1. **SQL Injection**: Tested using `http://127.0.0.1/Webgoat/attack` on the WebGoat platform.
2. **XSS Attack**: Exploited to inject scripts that steal session IDs.

## Learnings
- SQL Injection and XSS vulnerabilities can compromise web application security.
- Practical methods for identifying and mitigating these issues.
